# PCOS - Exploring Predictive Health Factors
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women, often during their reproductive years. It is characterized by symptoms such as:

- Irregular periods or no periods at all

- Excess androgen levels, which can cause acne, excess facial or body hair (hirsutism), and sometimes hair thinning

- Polycystic ovaries, where the ovaries may be enlarged and contain multiple small follicles

Possible Causes:
- Hormonal imbalances, particularly elevated androgens (male hormones)

- Insulin resistance, which can lead to higher insulin levels and contribute to weight gain and difficulty losing weight

- Genetics, as PCOS often runs in families

Treatment Options:
While thereâ€™s no cure for PCOS, treatments focus on managing symptoms and may include:

- Lifestyle changes, such as diet modifications and exercise, to help manage weight and insulin resistance

- Birth control pills to regulate periods and reduce androgen levels

- Medications like Metformin to improve insulin sensitivity

- Fertility treatments for those struggling to conceive
